----------
Here you can see my solution for item-catalog-project from FSND Udacity

**How run:**

 1. You need to have Vagrant and VirtualBox installed on your PC
 2. Clone this repo
 3. Go to root directory and run `vagrant up`
 4. You'll need to wait several minutes for installation of virtual machine
 5. When it done, run `vagrant ssh` to login to the VM.
 6. Inside the VM run `cd /vagrant`
 7. Type `python baseup.py` - it will setup Database
 8. Type `python addingcakes.py` to add "Zaher" like an example
 9. Type `python app.py` to start application
 10. Visit [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in your browser to test this appilcation.
